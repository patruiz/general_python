Progress
- MEGA FUCKED UP
    Cant just add parts in the part_data.csv as placeholders because they will mess up the count of the parts
    Just get every single part and create them in every single color 
    - How part numbering should go:
        - check if part is in Database
        - if part is not in database:
            - create a different color in each part and add it to database
        
        *For each new item, if it has new parts:
        - it should be added to the bottom of the item_data.csv 
        - and new colors of that part will be added to the database
        - do this for all new parts
    
    
*PANTONE
